# Motion
Motion is a social network where users can make new friendships, follow any users they like as well as create their own posts.

## Stack
- The frontend is built using React.js, Redux and Styled Components
- The Backend is built using Python, Django Rest Framework and PostgreSQL
- Docker, Docker-compose, Gitlab CI/CD and Nginx.

### The project is still not 100% completed, as the frontend still requires some re-works.
